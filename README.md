# ios-scriptable-widgets
A collection of my iOS widgets for the Scriptable app

## Requirements

- iOS 16 (or later)
- [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188) app 1.7 (188) or later - still in beta until now!

## iPhone Local Store Availability
Shows whether your desired iPhone is available for pickup at your nearest Apple Store. In this example, the left one is an iPhone SE (2020) and the right one is an iPhone 14 Pro. Tapping on the icon will open the Apple Store app with your chosen product to assure a fast order process.

You can configure both the part number (e.g. MQ1F3ZD/A) and zip code (50670) as widget parameter, separated with semicolon.

## Disclaimer
I have no affiliation with Apple and build these widgets just for fun on my free time. Those are not official products.
